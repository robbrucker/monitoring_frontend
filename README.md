This project is a time monitoring app. It was created to keep track of how my daughter slept. From there, came a need to keep time of other things she did, so that's what this app does. 

The flow is:
Create an account
Create item (ex: sleeping)
Start timer
     Edit time started
Stop Timer
     Edit time stopped
Delete timer
View total time for today
View all times for items
